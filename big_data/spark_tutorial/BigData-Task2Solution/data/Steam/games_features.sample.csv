While the game draws on identifiable sources such as Quake The Sims and Clue it mashes these elements together with a few new ideas to create an innovative experience that doesnt play like any of its inspirations.8.3 - Gamespotthe game twists around the Clue formula to make it a little more interesting. Instead of having to uncover a killer The Ship makes you the killer. The main gameplay mechanic revolves around finding your target called your quarry and breaking their face as stealthily as possible. To do so there are plenty of lethal odds-and-ends to wield and even some environmental traps. Its certainly a quirky take on first-person gaming but its an entertaining one once you get the hang of it.7.4 - IGN,English French German Italian Spanish Polish Russian Japanese,http://www.blazinggriffin.com/games/the-ship-murder-party/,Minimum: 1.8 GHz Processor 512MB RAM DirectX 8 level graphics card (1024x768) Windows 2000/XP/ME/98 Mouse Keyboard Internet Connection DirectX 9.0cRecommended: 2.8 GHz Processor 1024MB RAM DirectX 9 capable Graphics Card (1024x768) Windows 2000/XP/ME/98 Mouse Keyboard Internet Connection DirectX 9.0c,,,,,
